					<h2>Terms & Conditions</h2>
				</div>
				<h2>The gist</h2>
				<p>We (the folks at Tradesman) run a website and trade job platform called Tradesman.ie and would love for you to use it. Tradesman.ie’s basic service is free for tradesmen, and homeowners are only charged a deposit when they accept a quote (to book their tradesman). Our service is designed to facilitate the connection between homeowners and tradesmen and encourage them to find each other through a modern medium. However, be responsible in what you post and who you choose to work with. In particular, make sure that the information you provide is accurate and that the tradesman or homeowner you use is legitimate; we cannot do it on your behalf.</p>
				<p class="pt-10">If you find a Tradesman.ie user that you believe violates these Terms & Conditions, please report them through our Support system.</p>
				<h2>Terms & Conditions</h2>
				<p>The following terms and conditions (“Terms”) govern all use of the Tradesman.ie website and all content, services, and products available at or through the website. Our Services are offered subject to your acceptance without modification of all of the terms and conditions contained herein and all other operating rules, policies (including, without limitation, Tradesman.ie’s Privacy Policy) and procedures that may be published from time to time by Tradesman.ie (collectively, the “Agreement”). You agree that we may automatically upgrade our Services, and these Terms will apply to any upgrades.</p>
				<p class="pt-10">Please read this Agreement carefully before accessing or using our Services. By accessing or using any part of our Services, you agree to become bound by the Terms of this Agreement. If you do not agree to all the Terms of this Agreement, then you may not access or use any of our Services. If these Terms are considered an offer by Tradesman.ie, acceptance is expressly limited to these Terms.</p>
				<p class="pt-10">Our Services are not directed to users younger than 18, and access and use of our Services is only offered to users 18 years of age or older. If you are under 18 years old, please do not register to use our Services. Any person who registers as a user or provides their personal information to our Services represents that they are 18 years of age or older.</p>
				<p class="pt-10">Use of our Services requires a Tradesman.ie account. You agree to provide us with complete and accurate information when you register for an account. You will be solely responsible and liable for any activity that occurs under your username. You are responsible for keeping your password secure.</p>     
				<h2>Responsibility of Homeowners</h2>
				<p>If you post a job to Tradesman.ie, use the Tradesman.ie private messaging system, or otherwise make (or allow any third party to make) material available (any such material, “Content”), you are entirely responsible for the content of, and any harm resulting from, that Content or your conduct.</p>
				<p class="pt-10">You are responsible for the validity and accuracy of the information you provide on the job and the truthfulness of the details you give to tradesmen’s questions. Failing to comply with this requirement may result in receiving inaccurate quotes; the tradesmen are not bound to offer their services for the quote they submitted, and providing incomplete or inaccurate information to them can result in them refusing to work with you.</p>
				<p class="pt-10">You are required to verify the legitimacy of the tradesmen you choose to work with. Although tradesmen providing false information are in violation of these Terms & Conditions, it is your responsibility to protect yourself and your household against illegitimate or malicious contractors.</p>
				<h2>Responsibility of Tradesmen</h2>
				<p>If you register on Tradesman.ie as a tradesman, submit quotes or use the Tradesman.ie private messaging system, or otherwise make (or allow any third party to make) material available (any such material, “Content”), you are entirely responsible for the content of, and any harm resulting from, that Content or your conduct.</p>
				<p class="pt-10">You are responsible for the validity and accuracy of the information you provide during the registration process, through your profile, through your quotes and at all other interactions with Tradesman.ie and its users. You are required to be a registered professional in order to create a Tradesman.ie account.</p>
				<p class="pt-10">Registering for or operating a Tradesman.ie tradesman account without being registered as a company will result in the immediate termination of your account.</p>
				<p class="pt-10">You are required to be qualified for the trade under which you sign up. You may not, under any circumstances, change this after registration.</p>
				<p class="pt-10">Inappropriate quoting conduct (including but not limited to submitting unrealistically low quotes in order to have your quote chosen by the homeowners) will result in the permanent termination of your account.</p>
				<h2>The Booking Deposit</h2>
				<p>The Booking Deposit secures a homeowner’s booking for a tradesman. The deposit acts as a service fee, being a small percentage added on top of each tradesman quote.</p>
				<p class="pt-10">The homeowner is eligible for a refund if the following conditions are collectively met:</p>
				<p>– Work for the job has not commenced in any way;</p>
				<p>– No more than 31 days have passed since the date the job was submitted and no more than 7 days have passed since the date the deposit was paid;</p>
				<p>– The homeowner has attempted to contact the tradesman and didn’t get a satisfactory response (or a response at all).</p>
				<p class="pt-10">The homeowner will be required to submit proof of all of the above when they request a refund of the deposit; failure to provide any requested information will result in the denial of the request.</p>
				<p class="pt-10">For refunds of deposits paid via PayPal please submit a refund request through our website. Filing a dispute with PayPal will result in the termination of your account.</p>
				<h2>Web Traffic</h2>
				<p>We use a third party, Google Analytics. (“Analytics”), to measure Tradesman.ie’s audience and usage. By using our service, you agree to assign the traffic relating to your website to Tradesman.ie and authorize us to sign a Traffic Assignment Letter on your behalf for Google Analytics audience measurement reports.</p>
				<h2>Payments and Refunds</h2>
				<p>Tradesman.ie uses third party services, PayPal and Stripe (“Payment Gateways”) to collect and process payments and refunds. By using our service you agree to their Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policies.</p>
				<h2>Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy</h2>

In the case of such termination, Tradesman.ie will have no obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid to Tradesman.ie.</p>
